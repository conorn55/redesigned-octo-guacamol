# Homemade Gnocchi and Pesto
## Serves: 3

## Ingredients

### Gnocchi
- 180 g mashed potato (dry, well-chilled; minimal butter/milk)
- 72 g plain/all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1 small egg (or medium if only size available)
- Pinch of salt
- Pinch of black pepper
- ½ teaspoon olive oil (optional, helps bind)

### Pesto
- 1 cup (packed) fresh basil leaves (or other tender herbs)
- 2 tablespoons pine nuts (or walnuts/cashews)
- 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese (or other aged hard cheese)
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 small garlic clove, peeled
- Pinch of salt
- Pinch of black pepper

## Method

### 1. Prepare the Gnocchi
1. Ensure mashed potato is chilled and fairly dry.
2. In a bowl, combine the mashed potato, flour, egg, salt, pepper, and olive oil.
3. Mix gently until a stiff dough forms; avoid overmixing.
4. Lightly flour your work surface.
5. Divide dough into portions; roll each into a long rope about 2 cm thick.
6. Cut ropes into 2 cm pieces.
7. (Optional) Roll each piece over the back of a fork to create ridges.
8. Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.
9. Add gnocchi in batches; boil until they float (about 2–3 minutes).
10. Scoop out with a slotted spoon; set aside or proceed to toss with pesto.

### 2. Make the Pesto
1. In a food processor (or blender), combine basil, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.
2. Pulse to begin blending, then, with the motor running, drizzle in olive oil until smooth and emulsified.
3. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.

### 3. Combine & Serve
1. Gently toss the cooked gnocchi with pesto; add a splash of cooking water if needed to loosen sauce.
2. Serve warm with extra grated Parmesan if desired.
